This project is inspired by Jason Brownlee who trained machine to do addition of numbers by LSTM. You may visit his web page at:

In my project, I hope to do addition number of in a way similar to how human-beings do the job. I use images as source of data instead of creating random numbers directly. I use GenData.ipynb to create images for training. The training process is conducted using the OpenCV (digit_recognizer_training.ipynb). After training, use digit_recognizer_testing.ipynb to detect any object in an image.
